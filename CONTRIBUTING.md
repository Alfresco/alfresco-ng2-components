## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit a pull request please follow the steps below: 

* Search in  [GitHub PR](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/pulls) for an open or closed PR
  that could solve or already solves your issue.
* Search in the [GitHub release history](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/releases) to see if your
  issue has already been solved in a new version of ADF.
* Fork our repository (if you don't know how to do this, read [this GitHub document](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)).
* Make your changes in a new git branch starting from develop and following our [naming convention](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/wiki/Branching-Strategy)

     ```shell
     git checkout -b dev-{developerName}-{GitIssuedId/JiraIssueId} develop
     ```

* Create your PR **including appropriate test cases** following the [code contribution acceptance criteria](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/wiki/Code-contribution-acceptance-criteria)
* Run the tests and make sure they are green. Please don't comment out or exclude the tests that are already in place.
* Commit your change using the [commit format message good practice](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/wiki/Commit-format)
* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin dev-{developerName}-{GitIssuedId/JiraIssueId}
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `develop`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the tests.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git fetch develop
    git checkout dev-my-branch
    git rebase develop -i
    git push -f
    ```
Note: If you need more information about how to sync your fork, see [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

## Code style

The code style for ADF follows the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) plus some internal rules.
You donâ€™t have to worry too much about those rules because they are automatically checked by tslint/codelyzer/adf-rules.
If your code is not compliant with one of these rules you will see an error when you build the project along with some help on how to fix it.

The ADF-Rules are as follows:

* File name component/directive cannot start with Alfresco/Activiti/adf - this rule is to help developers find files easily
* Class names cannot start with Alfresco/Activiti/adf for the same reason as above
* scss is mandatory. All the classes need to have the `adf-` prefix

## Test guide

In ADF, we encourage the use of behavior-driven development (BDD).

### General guidelines

* Class selector in all the tests is not suggested. Use of the element ID is preferred
* Any test case should test only one behavior
* Use of the Angular [testBed](https://angular.io/guide/testing#testbed) is highly recommended

### File name

* The file name specification must be the same as the component/service/pipe it tests plus the .spec. suffix.
* The specification file must be in the same folder as the component/service/pipe it tests.

### Describer Name

* The Main describer of the test should be the name of the class under test
* The sub describe is used for grouping related behavior test. Do not overuse it.

### Test Name

Any test should follow the naming convention:

[Should] [ ***Expected Behavior*** ] [when/after/before] [ ***State Under Test*** ].
