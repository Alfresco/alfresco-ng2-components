## Code style

The code style in the ADF code follow the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) plus some internal rules.
you donâ€™t have to worry too much about out those rules because are automatically checked by tslint/codelyzer/adf-rules.
If your code is not complaint to one of this rules you will receive and error when you build the project with some help on how to fix it.
The ADF-Rules :
* File name component/directive can not to start with Alfresco/Activiti/adf this rules is to help developer to find files easily
* Class name can not to start with Alfresco/Activiti/adf for the same reason above
* scss is mandatory and the class have to start with the adf- prefix
