# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

 # These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these users will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

 # Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

 # The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
