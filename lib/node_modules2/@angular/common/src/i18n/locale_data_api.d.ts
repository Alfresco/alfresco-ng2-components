 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short
