## Process Filters Component

Process filters are a collection of criteria used to filter process instances, which may be customized
by users. This component displays a list of available filters and allows the user to select any given
filter as the active filter.

The most common usage is in driving a process instance list in order to allow the user to choose which
process instances are displayed in the list.

```html
<activiti-process-instance-filters
    appId="1001">
</activiti-process-instance-filters>
```

### Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filterParam | [FilterParamsModel](#filterparamsmodel) | The params to filter the task filter. If there is no match the default one (first filter of the list) is selected |
| appId | string | Display filters available to the current user for the application with the specified ID. |
| appName | string | Display filters available to the current user for the application with the specified name. |
| hasIcon | boolean | Toggle to show or not the filter's icon. |

If both `appId` and `appName` are specified then `appName` will take precedence and `appId` will be ignored.

### Events

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| onSuccess | Raised when the list of filters hase been successfully loaded from the server |
| onError | Raised when an error occurs |
| filterClick | Raised when the user selects a filter from the list |

### How filter the activiti process filters

 ```

You can use inside the filterParam one of the following property.

## FilterParamsModel

```json
{
    "id": "number",
    "name": "string",
    "index": "number"
}
```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The id of the task filter. |

| index | number | Zero-based position of the filter in the array. |

### How to create an accordion menu with the processes filter

The AccordionComponent is exposed by the alfresco-core.

        [isSelected]="true" 
        [headingIcon]="'assessment'">
        <activiti-process-instance-filters
            [appId]="appId"
            (filterClick)="onProcessFilterClick($event)"
            (onSuccess)="onSuccessProcessFilterList($event)">
        </activiti-process-instance-filters>
    </adf-accordion-group>
</adf-accordion>
```
