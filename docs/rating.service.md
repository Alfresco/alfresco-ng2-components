## Details

The `ratingType` string currently has two possible options, "likes"
and "fiveStar". When the "likes" scheme is used, the result of
`getRating` and the `vote` parameter of `postRating` are boolean
values. When "fiveStar" is used, the value is an integer representing
the number of stars out of five.
