## Details

### Editing APS2 task filters

Use the `appName` and `id` properties to choose which task filter to edit:

```html
<adf-cloud-edit-task-filter
    [id]="taskFilterId"
    [appName]="appName">
</adf-cloud-edit-task-filter>
```

### Filter properties

You can supply various _filter properties_ to edit that will determine
which tasks are found by a filter. The full set of properties is
given below:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **_appName_** | Name of the app |
| **_status_** | Execution state of the task. |
| **_assignee_** | User the task is assigned to |
| **_taskName_** | Name of the task |
| **_taskId_** | ID of the task |
| **_parentTaskId_** | ID of the task's parent task |
| **_priority_** | Task priority |
| **_createdDate_** | Date the task was created |
| **_standalone_** | Standalone status of the task |
| **_owner_** | User ID of the task's owner |
| **_processDefinitionId_** | Process definition ID |
| **_processInstanceId_** | Process instance ID |
| **_lastModified_** | Date the task was last modified. If lastModified defined the component will show the range **_lastModifiedFrom_**, **_lastModifiedTo_** |
| **_sort_** | Field on which the filter results will be sorted (doesn't participate in the filtering itself). Can be "id", "name", "createdDate", "priority", "processDefinitionId". |
| **_order_** | Sort ordering of the filter results it can be ASC or DESC (doesn't participate in the filtering itself). |

By default, the **_status_**, **_assignee_**, **_sort_** and **_order_** properties
are displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which properties
to show using the `filterProperties` array. For example, the code below initializes
the editor with the **_appName_**, **_processInstanceId_**, **_createdDate_** and
**_lastModified_** properties:

```ts
import { UserProcessModel } from '@alfresco/adf-core';

export class SomeComponent implements OnInit {

    filterProperties: string[] = [
        "appName",
        "processInstanceId",
        "createdDate",
        "lastModified"];

    onFilterChange(filter: TaskFilterCloudModel) {
        console.log('On filter change: ', filter);
    }

    onAction($event: TaskFilterAction) {
        console.log('Clicked action: ', $event);
    }
```

With this configuration, only the four listed properties will be shown.

### Sort properties

You can supply a list of _sort properties_ to sort the tasks. You can use
any of the [filter properties](#filter-properties) listed above as
sort properties and you can also use the task **_id_** property and
use **_name_** as a shorthand for **_taskName_**.

By default, the **_id_**,  **_name_**, **_createdDate_** and **_priority_** properties are
displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which sort properties
to show using the `sortProperties` array.
For example, the code below initializes the editor with the **_createdDate_** , **_lastModified_** and **_priority_** properties:

```ts
export class SomeComponent implements OnInit {

    sortProperties: string[] = [
        "createdDate",
        "lastModified",
        "priority"];

    onFilterChange(filter: TaskFilterCloudModel) {
        console.log('On filter change: ', filter);
    }

    onAction($event: TaskFilterAction) {
        console.log('Clicked action: ', $event);
    }
```

```html
<adf-cloud-edit-task-filter
    [id]="taskFilterId"
    [appName]="applicationName"
    [sortProperties]="sortProperties">
</adf-cloud-edit-task-filter>
```

With this configuration, only the three listed sort properties will be shown.

### Action properties

You can supply various _actions_ to apply on task filter.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **_save_** | Save task filter. |
| **_saveAs_** | Creates a new task filter. |
| **_delete_** | Delete task filter. |

By default, the **_save_**, **_saveAs_** and **_delete_** actions are
displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which actions to
show using the `actions` array.
For example, the code below initializes the editor with the **_save_** and **_delete_** actions:

```ts
export class SomeComponent implements OnInit {

    actions: string[] = ['save', 'delete'];

    onFilterChange(filter: TaskFilterCloudModel) {
        console.log('On filter change: ', filter);
    }

    onAction($event: TaskFilterAction) {
        console.log('Clicked action: ', $event);
    }
```

```html
<adf-cloud-edit-task-filter
    [id]="taskFilterId"
    [appName]="applicationName"
    [actions]="actions">
</adf-cloud-edit-task-filter>
```

With this configuration, only the two actions will be shown.

## Saving custom filters

Users can save a filter if they make any changes to it in an application using the **Save** icon. How it is saved is dictated by the Activiti version used: 

-   An Activiti 7 community version stores saved filters in the local browser storage. This restricts a user's custom filters to that single session.

-   An Activiti Enterprise version uses the preference service to store saved filters. This allows for user's custom filters to be available between sessions and between devices.
