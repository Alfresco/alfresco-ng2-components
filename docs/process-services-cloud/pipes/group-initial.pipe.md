# [Group initial pipe](../../../lib/process-services-cloud/src/lib/group/pipe/group-initial.pipe.ts "Defined in group-initial.pipe.ts")

Extracts the initial character from a group name.

## Basic Usage

<!-- {% raw %} -->

```HTML
<div>
    Group: {{ currentGroup | groupNameInitial }}
</div>
```

<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## Details

This pipe takes a [`IdentityGroupModel`](../../../lib/core/userinfo/models/identity-group.model.ts)
object as its parameter and extracts the initial character from the `name`
property. The initial is a handy way to identify the group in lists and
other situations where there is limited screen space available.
