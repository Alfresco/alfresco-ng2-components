## Details

### Editing APS2 process filters

Use the `appName` and `id` properties to choose which process filter to edit:

```html
<adf-cloud-edit-process-filter
    [id]="processFilterId"
    [appName]="appName">
</adf-cloud-edit-process-filter>
```

### Filter properties

You can supply various _filter properties_ to edit that will determine
which processes are found by a filter. The full set of properties is
given below:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **_appName_** | Name of the app |
| **_processInstanceId_** | Process instance ID |
| **_processName_** | Process name. |
| **_initiator_** | ID of the user who initiated the process |
| **_state_** | Execution state of the process. |
| **_processDefinitionId_** | Process definition ID |
| **_processDefinitionKey_** | Process definition key |
| **_lastModified_** | Date the process was last modified |
| **_startDate_** | Date the process was started |
| **_sort_** | Field on which the filter results will be sorted (doesn't participate in the filtering itself). Can be "id", "name", "status" or "startDate". |
| **_order_** | Sort ordering of the filter results (this doesn't participate in the filtering itself) |

By default, the **_state_**, **_sort_** and **_order_** properties are
displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which properties
to show using the `filterProperties` array.
For example, the code below initializes the editor with the **_appName_**,
**_processInstanceId_**, **_startDate_** and **_lastModified_** properties:

```ts
import { UserProcessModel } from '@alfresco/adf-core';

export class SomeComponent implements OnInit {

    filterProperties: string[] = [
        "appName",
        "processInstanceId",
        "startDate",
        "lastModified"];

    onFilterChange(filter: ProcessFilterCloudModel) {
        console.log('On filter change: ', filter);
    }

    onAction($event: ProcessFilterActionType) {
        console.log('Clicked action: ', $event);
    }
```

With this configuration, only the four listed properties will be shown.

**Note:** Currently, the `sort` property has a limited set of properties
to choose from: **_id_**, **_name_**, **_status_** and **_startDate_**.
