## Basic usage

```html
<adf-search-control 
    [highlight]="true"
    (optionClicked)="onItemClicked($event)"

### [Transclusions](../../user-guide/transclusion.md)

You can show your own custom template when no results are found for the search:

```html
<adf-search-control [highlight]="true"
                    (optionClicked)="onItemClicked($event)"
                    (submit)="onSearchSubmit($event)">
    <adf-empty-search-result>
        <!-- YOUR CUSTOM TEMPLATE HERE -->
        <span>YOUR CUSTOM MESSAGE</span>
    </adf-empty-search-result>
</adf-search-control>
```

| optionClicked | [`EventEmitter`](https://angular.io/api/core/EventEmitter)`<any>` | Emitted when a file item from the list of "find-as-you-type" results is selected. |
| searchChange | [`EventEmitter`](https://angular.io/api/core/EventEmitter)`<string>` | Emitted when the search term is changed. The search term is provided in the 'value' property of the returned object.  If the term is less than three characters in length then it is truncated to an empty string. |
| submit | `EventEmitter<any>` | Emitted when the search is submitted by pressing the ENTER key. The search term is provided as the value of the event. |

## Details

Below is an example of a component that uses the search control. In this example the search term is simply logged to the console. However, the component could instead emit an event to be consumed upstream,or it could trigger a change inside a search results component embedded inside the same component.

```html
<adf-search-control 
    [highlight]="true"
    (optionClicked)="onItemClicked($event)"
    (submit)="onSearchSubmit($event)">
</adf-search-control>
```
