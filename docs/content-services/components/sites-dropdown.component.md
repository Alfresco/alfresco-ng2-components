| hideMyFiles | `boolean` | false | Hide the "My Files" option. |
| placeholder | `string` |  | Text or a translation key to act as a placeholder. Default value is the key "DROPDOWN.PLACEHOLDER_LABEL". |
| relations | `string` |  | Filter for the results of the sites query. Possible values are "members" and "containers". When "members" is used, the site list will be restricted to the sites that the user is a member of. |
