# [Upload Version Button Component (Workaround)](../../../lib/content-services/src/lib/upload/components/upload-version-button.component.ts "Defined in upload-version-button.component.ts")

Activates a file version upload.

Until further backend API improvements are implemented, this component is meant to be used
to enrich the features and decrease the restrictions currently applied to node version uploading.

## Basic usage

```html
<adf-upload-version-button
    staticTitle="Upload new version"
    [node]="node"
    [rootFolderId]="node.parentId"
    [versioning]="true"
    (success)="onUploadSuccess($event)"
    (error)="onUploadError($event)">
</adf-upload-version-button>
```

## Details

This component extends the [Upload Button component](upload-button.component.md). The
properties and events are the same except for the `node` property that specifies the node
to be versioned (this is a *required* input parameter). However, some properties don't make
sense when applied to the [Upload Version Button component](upload-version-button.component.md) so they are simply ignored.
