### Events

## Details

Pass this directive the id of the parent folder where you want the new folder node to be created.
If no value is provided, the '-my-' alias is used.
This will open a [Folder Dialog component](../../../lib/content-services/dialogs/folder.dialog.ts) to receive data for the new folder. If the data is valid
then the dialog will emit a `success` event when it closes.
