# Version compatibility

The table below shows the versions of Alfresco's backend services that
have been tested with recent versions of ADF. Note that *smoke testing*
means that the version should be safe to use (ie, it won't "catch fire")
but it is not guaranteed to be free of minor issues or missing features.

You can find further information about released versions of ADF in the
[version index](versionIndex.md) and the [release notes](release-notes/README.md).
