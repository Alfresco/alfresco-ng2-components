# Version compatibility

The table below shows the versions of Alfresco's backend services that
have been tested with latest versions of ADF.

Our goal is to support ADF for *all* versions of Content Services
and Process Services. However, we only test against a subset of those
versions that believe to be representative. If a bug is reported for a
version that we don't test against then the bug will still be fixed in
the next release (ie, the fact that a version is not tested doesn't mean that it isn't supported).

Note that [*smoke testing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_%28software%29) implies that the product will not "go up in smoke" when
used but the tests are quicker and not as thorough as with *full testing*.

You can find further information about released versions of ADF in the
[version index](versionIndex.md) and the [release notes](release-notes/README.md).
