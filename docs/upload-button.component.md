## Details

### How to show notification message with no permission

You can show a notification error when the user doesn't have the right permission to perform the action.
The UploadButtonComponent provides the event permissionEvent that is raised when the delete permission is missing
You can subscribe to this event from your component and use the NotificationService to show a message.

```html
<adf-upload-button
    [rootFolderId]="currentFolderId"
    (permissionEvent)="onUploadPermissionFailed($event)">
</adf-upload-button>
```

```ts
export class MyComponent {

    onUploadPermissionFailed(event: any) {
        this.notificationService.openSnackMessage(
            `you don't have the ${event.permission} permission to ${event.action} the ${event.type} `, 4000
        );
    }

}
```

### How to disable the button when the delete permission is missing

You can easily disable the button when the user doesn't have the permission to perform the action.
The UploadButtonComponent provides the property disableWithNoPermission that can be true. In this way the button should be disabled if the delete permission is missing for the node.

```html
<adf-upload-button
    [rootFolderId]="currentFolderId"
    [disableWithNoPermission]="true">
</adf-upload-button>
```
