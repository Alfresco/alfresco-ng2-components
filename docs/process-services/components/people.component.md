### How to customize the people component behavior

The [people component](people.component.md) provides two options to customize its behavior:

*   *involveUserAndCloseSearch*: The selected user gets added and then the search section is closed
*   *involveUserWithoutCloseSearch*: The selected user gets added without closing the search section

This makes it easy to customize the [people component](people.component.md) to involve the user via a single or double click event:

### Involve People single click and close search

```html
<adf-people #people
    (row-click)="people.involveUserAndCloseSearch()"
    [people]="YOUR_INVOLVED_PEOPLE_LIST"
    [taskId]="YOUR_TASK_ID"
    [readOnly]="YOUR_READ_ONLY_FLAG">
</adf-people>
```

### Involve People single click without close search

```html
<adf-people #people
    (row-click)="people.involveUserWithoutCloseSearch()"
    [people]="YOUR_INVOLVED_PEOPLE_LIST"
    [taskId]="YOUR_TASK_ID"
    [readOnly]="YOUR_READ_ONLY_FLAG">
</adf-people>
```
