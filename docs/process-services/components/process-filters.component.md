## Details

This component displays a list of available filters and allows the user to select any given
filter as the active filter.

The most common usage is in driving a process instance list to allow the user to choose which
process instances are displayed in the list.

If both `appId` and `appName` are specified then `appName` will take precedence and `appId` will be ignored.

### How filter the activiti process filters

```html
<adf-process-instance-filters 
   [filterParam]="{index: 0}">
</adf-process-instance-filters>
```

You can use inside the filterParam one of the properties defined by [`FilterParamsModel`](../../../lib/process-services/src/lib/task-list/models/filter.model.ts) (see below).

### FilterParamsModel

```json
{
    "id": "number",
    "name": "string",
    "index": "number"
}
```

| Name  | Type   | Description                                        |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| id    | string | The id of the task filter.                         |
| name  | string | The name of the task filter, lowercase is checked. |
| index | number | Zero-based position of the filter in the array.    |
