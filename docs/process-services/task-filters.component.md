### Filtering APS task filters

Use the `filterParam` property to restrict the range of filters that are shown:

```html
<adf-task-filters 
   [filterParam]="{name:'My tasks'}">
</adf-task-filters>
```

You can use properties from [`FilterParamsModel`](../../lib/process-services/task-list/models/filter.model.ts)
as the value of `filterParam` as shown in the table below:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | The id of the task filter |
| name | string | The name of the task filter, lowercase is checked |
| index | string | The zero-based position of the filter in the array. |

### How to create an accordion menu with the task filter

The task filter often works well as an item in an accordion menu. See the
[Accordion component](../core/accordion.component.md)
page for an example of how to set this up.
