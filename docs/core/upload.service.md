## Details

### Ignore list configuration

You can add an ignore list for files that you don't want to be uploaded on your CS.
The configuration of this service is saved in the `app.config.json` file
(see the [App Config service](app-config.service.md) for more information).

The example below shows how to filter out the : '.git', '.DS_Store' and 'desktop.ini' files.
Each element of the ignore list is a glob pattern string, so you could exclude all the `.txt`
files, for example, by adding a `*.txt` pattern to the list.

**app.config.json**

```json
{
    "ecmHost": "http://localhost:3000/ecm",
    "bpmHost": "http://localhost:3000/bpm",
    "application": {
        "name": "Alfresco"
    },
    "files": {
          "excluded": [".DS_Store", "desktop.ini", ".git", "*.txt"]
    }
}
```

Note that all standard glob patterns work and you can end patterns with a forward
slash `/` character to specify a directory.
