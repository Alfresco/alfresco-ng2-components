# [User Process model](../../../lib/process-services/src/lib/common/models/user-process.model.ts "Defined in user-process.model.ts")

Represents a Process Services user.

## Details

This class contains basic information about a Process Services user and
is used throughout ADF to identify and list users (eg, to assign them to
a task or to list them in search results).

Note that the Typescript class for this model is in active development;
it is likely to change and so its properties are not listed here. For the
latest version of the class, see the
[source file](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/develop/lib/core/models/user-process.model.ts).
