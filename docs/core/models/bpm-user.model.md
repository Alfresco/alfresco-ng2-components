Contains information about a Process Services user.

## Details

Instances of this class are returned by the methods of the
[Bpm User service](../services/bpm-user.service.md). It implements the
[`UserRepresentation`](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-js-api/blob/develop/src/api/activiti-rest-api/docs/UserRepresentation.md) interface, which is defined in the
[Alfresco JS API](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-js-api/blob/master/src/alfresco-activiti-rest-api/docs/UserRepresentation.md).

Note that the Typescript class for this model is in active development;
it is likely to change and so its properties are not listed here. For the
latest version of the class, see the
[source file](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/develop/lib/core/userinfo/models/bpm-user.model.ts).
