## Details

You can bind the directive instance to a template variable through the **adfFavorite** reference,
which also lets you add extra styling to the element:

<!-- {% raw %} -->

```html
<button
    mat-menu-item
    #selection="adfFavorite"
    [ngClass]="{ 'icon-highlight': selection.hasFavorites() }"
    [adf-node-favorite]="documentList.selection">
    <mat-icon [ngClass]="{ 'icon-highlight': selection.hasFavorites() }">
        {{ selection.hasFavorites() ? 'star' : 'star_border' }}
    </mat-icon>
</button>
```

<!-- {% endraw %} -->

The directive behaves as follows:

*   If there are no favorite nodes in the selection, then all are marked as favorites
*   If there are one or more favorite nodes in the selection, then only those that are not
    favorites are marked
*   If all nodes in the selection are favorites, then they all have their favorite status removed

See the **Demo Shell** for examples of usage.
