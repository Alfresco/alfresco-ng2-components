Contains information about a Content Services user.

## Details

Instances of this class are returned by the methods of the
[Ecm User service](ecm-user.service.md). It implements the `Person`
interface, which is defined in the
[Alfresco JS API](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-js-api/blob/master/src/alfresco-core-rest-api/docs/Person.md).

Note that the Typescript class for this model is in active development;
it is likely to change and so its properties are not listed here. For the
latest version of the class, see the
[source file](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/lib/core/userinfo/models/ecm-user.model.ts).
