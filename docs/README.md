# Component Docs Index

Below is an index of the documentation for ADF. The [User Guide](#user-guide)
section discusses particular techniques in depth. The other sections are references for the ADF
libraries. Click the name of an item to see its documentation or click the source link to see
its main source file. Note that ADF is developed continuously, so the source files for some items may be listed here before their documentation is available.

See the [Version Index](versionIndex.md) for a list of components ordered by
the ADF version where they were introduced.

Components are sometimes marked with an icon to show their status. No icon indicates
that the component is complete and suitable for normal use. The other status levels are:

-   **Deprecated** ![](docassets/images/DeprecatedIcon.png) - The component is still available
    but is now obsolete and will probably be removed in a future version of ADF.
-   **Experimental** ![](docassets/images/ExperimentalIcon.png) - The component is available for
    experimentation but not fully complete and tested for production code.

There is also a set of ADF tutorials that describe how to accomplish tasks step-by-step.
See the [Tutorials index](tutorials/README.md) for the full list.
