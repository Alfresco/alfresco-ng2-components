## Goals for this release

In the ADF 1.9 release we've enhanced a number of components, such as Document List, Viewer and Breadcrumbs. We continue the effort to migrate to @angular/material, only a few more components remain until we are fully switched to Angular Material Design. Again in this release we have enhanced the accessibility and we have started to consolidate, streamline and enhance our documentation. Before everything was inside the individual README.md files, this has now been pulled out into a [separate directory](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/master/docs), and a new [Doc Index](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/master/docs/README.md) to help navigate it.

This is the last LA release, we are targeting ADF 2.0 by the end of November at which point it will become **General Available** and **fully supported** by Alfresco. As part of this effort we have increased the efforts on resolving bugs and stabilisation.

This release builds on last month's contains bug fixes and the new features. See the list below for major details.

Please report issues with this release in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/issues). You can collaborate on this release or share feedback by using the discussion tools on [gitter](https://gitter.im/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components).

## Notable new features

Below the most relevant features of this release:

-   Infinite scrolling
-   Requeue option added to adf-task-header
-   Tasklist now support multi-select
-   [Page title service](../core/services/page-title.service.md)
-   Viewer enhancements
-   Document List presets
-   Login redirect options
-   [Logout directive](../core/directives/logout.directive.md)
-   Breadcrumb enhancements
-   Documentation

### 1.Infinite scrolling

The document list now provides two different way to paginate the results the normal pagination or the infinite scrolling.
In order to enable this feature, you need to specify the paginationStrategy properties 'Infinite'. The infinite scrolling is also now used as default in the object picker component

### 2.Requeue option added to adf-task-header

The requeue feature has been added into the ADF 1.9.0. This means that after a task has been claimed by the user, the user will see a button Requeue to un-claim the task.

### 3.Tasklist multi-selection support

With the latest code, the tasklist component exposes the **multiselect** property. If the value is true a checkbox is rendered at the beginning of each row. In this way, the user can select more than one row.

    <adf-tasklist
        [multiselect]="true"
        [appId]="'1'"
        [state]="'open'"
        [assignment]="'assignee'">
    </adf-tasklist>

### 

This is the result:

![Tasklist multiselection](images/Screen+Shot+2017-10-09+at+15.51.31.png)

The component also provides a new event **rowSelected** that contains all the selected rows:

    <adf-tasklist
        [appId]="'1'"
        [state]="'open'"
        [assignment]="'assignee'"
        (rowsSelected)="console.log($event)">
    </adf-tasklist>

![task list rowsSelected ](images/Screen+Shot+2017-10-09+at+16.01.46.png)

### 4.Page Title Service

The 1.9.0 version features a new service ["PageTitleService"](../core/services/page-title.service.md) in the "ng2-alfresco-core" package. This service allows changing the title of the page (browser tab) on demand from the code. The format of the title is always "&lt;Application Name> - &lt;Title>" where "&lt;Application Name>" is taken from the application configuration file:

    {
      "application": {
        "name": "Alfresco ADF Appplication"
      }
    }

### 5.Viewer Enhancements

[Viewer component](../core/components/viewer.component.md) has been updated with improved UI and support for integration with Angular Router.
The major features and improvements are:

-   New [toolbar component](../core/components/toolbar.component.md) for all Viewer types
-   Automatic PDF rendition fetching for various content types (".docx", ".pptx", etc.)
-   Floating action toolbar for the PDF viewer

### 6.Document List Presets

It is now possible to store layouts for Document List in the global application configuration file ("app.config.json") for default mode or special aliases like "-trashcan-", "-favorites-", etc. The DocumentList component automatically falls back to the defaults if no customizations are present.

    {
        ...,

        "document-list": {
            "supportedPageSizes": [5, 10, 15, 20],
            "presets": {
                "-trashcan-": [
                    {
                        "key": "$thumbnail",

                    {
                        "key": "name",
                        "type": "text",
                        "title": "ADF-DOCUMENT-LIST.LAYOUT.NAME",
                        "cssClass": "full-width ellipsis-cell",
                        "sortable": true
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "path",
                        "type": "location",
                        "title": "ADF-DOCUMENT-LIST.LAYOUT.LOCATION",
                        "format": "/files",
                        "sortable": true
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "content.sizeInBytes",
                        "type": "fileSize",
                        "title": "ADF-DOCUMENT-LIST.LAYOUT.SIZE",
                        "sortable": true
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "archivedAt",
                        "type": "date",
                        "title": "ADF-DOCUMENT-LIST.LAYOUT.DELETED_ON",
                        "format": "timeAgo",
                        "sortable": true
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "archivedByUser.displayName",
                        "type": "text",
                        "title": "ADF-DOCUMENT-LIST.LAYOUT.DELETED_BY",
                        "sortable": true
                    }
                ],

                "default": [
                    ...
                ]
            }
        }
    }

### 7.Login redirect options

The [Login component](../core/components/login.component.md) provides a new **successRoute** property as a way to automatically redirect the user to the particular application route upon successful sign in.

    <adf-login successRoute="/dashboard" ...></adf-login>

### 8.Logout directive

You can turn any clickable HTML element or other Angular Component into a Logout feature. ADF provides a new **adf-logout** directive to help you building application menus or toolbar buttons that sign the user out:

    <button adf-logout>Log out</button>

### 9.Breadcrumb enhancements

The [Breadcrumb component](../content-services/components/breadcrumb.component.md) exposes a new **rootId** property to allow you restricting the root element to a particular node. Component automatically trims the elements if full node path needs to be cut. You can use this together with the **root** property that allows renaming the root (first) element of the path.

    <adf-breadcrumb root="Personal Files" rootId="<GUID>" ...></adf-breadcrumb>

### 10.Documentation

All the documentation was inside the individual README.md files of any components, this has now been pulled out into a separate directory, and a new [Doc Index](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/master/docs/README.md) to help navigate it.
