### DocumentList filtering

This enhancement allows an end-user to filter the results in the document list, similarly to Excel/Google sheets (filter in the header), so that the view on the repository can be customized accordingly with her/his needs.

Filter components can be disabled, customized or replaced with custom components. You can check [ACA-3206](https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ACA-3206) for further details.
