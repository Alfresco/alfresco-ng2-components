## Goals for this release

This is the first minor release after Alfresco Application Development Framework version 3, available to the developers since February 2019.

This release pushes a step further in the direction of the complete support of [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti. In addition to that, some enhancements has been introduced to the DocumentList and the Metadata viewer, as a consequence of some requests coming from the eco-system of developers using ADF in specific use cases.

Another enhancement introduced in ADF 3.1, is about search pattern highlight, considered as relevant in Share and since today available in ADF application as well.

In the area of the [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility), the new release of ADF take advantage of some bugfix and enhancements related to [Section508](https://www.section508.gov/).

Following the good amount of requests coming from the developers, we are pleased to announce the official support of Arabic and the support of Right To Left languages in ADF applications. The benefit for the market is clear, opening the application of ADF (and Alfresco solutions in general) to a broader number of potential users and use cases.
