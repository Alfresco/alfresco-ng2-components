## New package versions

    "@alfresco/adf-content-services" : "3.1.0"
    "@alfresco/adf-process-services" : "3.1.0"

## Goals for this release

This is the first minor release since ADF version 3 which was released in February 2019.

This release goes a step further in the direction of complete support for [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti. Also, some enhancements have been introduced to the DocumentList and the Metadata viewer, as a consequence of some requests coming from the eco-system of developers using ADF in complex applications.

Another enhancement introduced in ADF 3.1, is search pattern highlighting, considered as relevant in Share and now available to ADF applications as of this version.

In the area of [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility), the new release of ADF takes advantage of some bugfixes and enhancements related to [Section508](https://www.section508.gov/).

Following the good number of requests coming from developers, we are pleased to announce the official support of Arabic and Right To Left languages in ADF applications. The benefit for the market is clear, opening up to a broader number of potential users and use cases.

Please report issues with this release in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/issues/new). You can collaborate on this release or share feedback by using the discussion tools on [Gitter](http://gitter.im/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components).

### More on Activiti 7

In ADF 3.0.0 (released in February) we announced the introduction of the new `*Cloud` package. This contains a set of components to support [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti BPM Engine. With the ADF 3.1 release, the journey continues with more supported features, like: 

#### Claim a task

```html
<button adf-claim-task [appName]="appName" [taskId]="taskId" (success)="onTaskClaimed()">Complete</button>
```

For more details refer to the :

-   [Claim task directive](../process-services-cloud/directives/claim-task.directive.md) 

#### EditTaskComponent allows sorting and actions customization

You can supply various _filter properties_ to edit that will determine
which tasks are found by a filter.

By default, the **_id_**,  **_name_**, **_createdDate_** and **_priority_** properties are
displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which sort properties
to show using the `sortProperties` array.

For more details refer to the :

-   [Edit Task Filter Cloud component](../process-services-cloud/components/edit-task-filter-cloud.component.md) 

#### EditProcessComponent allow sorting and actions customization

You can supply various _filter properties_ to edit that will determine
which tasks are found by a filter.

By default, the **_status_**, **_sort_** and **_order_** properties are
displayed in the editor. However, you can also choose which properties
to show using the `filterProperties` array.

For more details refer to the :

-   [Edit Process Filter Cloud component](../process-services-cloud/components/edit-process-filter-cloud.component.md) 

#### Complete task directive

```html
<button adf-cloud-complete-task [appName]="appName" [taskId]="taskId" (success)="onTaskCompleted()">Complete</button>
```

For more details refer to the :

-   [Complete task directive](../process-services-cloud/directives/complete-task.directive.md) 

### Enhanced DocumentList

Following some suggestions from customers and partners, we enhanced the `Datatable` and `Document List` to allow a "sticky" header.
If you have a long table with many rows, you might want to fix the header in place so it is
always visible. You can do this using the following steps.

First, set the `stickyHeader` property of your datatable to `true`:

```html
<adf-datatable 
    [data]="data"
    [stickyHeader]="true">
</adf-datatable>
```

```html
<adf-document-list
    [data]="data"
    [stickyHeader]="true">
</adf-document-list>
```

For more details refer to the :

-   [Document List Component](../content-services/components/document-list.component.md) 
-   [DataTable component](../core/components/datatable.component.md) 

### Enhanced Metadata viewer

As of this version of ADF, developers can include the full list of types/aspects into the metadata viewer, without the need to specify all of them. The limit of the previous version was that developers were requested to specify the list of types/aspects or an asterisk to say "include all". The use case represented by "include all except X, Y, Z..." was not covered but now it is.

You can list all the properties by simply adding  `includeAll: boolean` to your config. This config will display all the aspects and properties available for that specific file.

```json
"content-metadata": {
    "presets": {
        "default": {
            "includeAll": true
        }
    }
}
```

Futhermore, you can also exclude specific aspects by adding the `exclude` property. It can be either a string if it's only one aspect or an array if you want to exclude multiple aspects at once:

```json
"content-metadata": {
    "presets": {
        "default": {
            "includeAll": true,
            "exclude": "exif:exif"
        }
    }
}
```

For more details refer to the :

-   [Content Metadata Card component](../content-services/components/content-metadata-card.component.md) 

### Search pattern highlight

As another example of good feedback we had from the developers on the ground about improving ADF, we introduced the custom highlighting of results in search. With ADF 3.1, developers can customize the pattern highlighting and the markers to use.

You can configure highlighting using the `search` entry in the `app.config.json` file.
An example query for search highlighting could look like this:

```json
{
    "search": {
      "highlight": {
        "prefix": "¿",
        "postfix": "?",
        "mergeContiguous": true,
        "fields": [
          {
            "field": "cm:title"
          },
          {
            "field": "description",
            "prefix": "(",
            "postfix": ")"
          }
    
        ]
      }
  }
}
```

The example above changes the highlighting prefix and postfix from the default  to '¿?' for all
fields except the "description" field, which uses '()' instead. The highlight information will
then be added in each node entry response.

For more details refer to the :

-   [Search Filter component highlight](../content-services/components/search-filter.component.md#highlight) 

### Facet Intervals

These provide custom categories based on admin defined ranges inside `intervals`.
You can specify exactly what you want for each interval in the config file and you can
use overlapping ranges if necessary.

#### FacetIntervals Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| intervals | array | Specifies the fields to facet by interval. |
| expanded | boolean | Toggles expanded state of the facet intervals. |

Note: the `sets` parameter from the Search API (which sets the intervals for all fields)
is not yet supported.

```json
{
    "search": {
      "facetIntervals":{
        "expanded": true,
        "intervals":[
          {
            "label":"TheCreated",
            "field":"cm:created",
            "sets":[
              { "label":"lastYear", "start":"2017", "end":"2018", "endInclusive":false },
              { "label":"currentYear", "start":"NOW/YEAR", "end":"NOW/YEAR+1YEAR" },
              { "label":"earlier", "start":"*", "end":"2017", "endInclusive":false }
            ]
          },
          {
            "label":"TheModified",
            "field":"cm:modified",
            "sets":[
              { "label":"2016", "start":"2017", "end":"2018", "endInclusive":false },
              { "label":"currentYear", "start":"NOW/YEAR", "end":"NOW/YEAR+1YEAR" },
              { "label":"earlierThan2017", "start":"*", "end":"2017", "endInclusive":false }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
  }
}
```

You can specify a value for the `mincount` property inside each `intervals` item to set the minimum count required for a facet interval to be displayed. By default, only the intervals that have 1 or more response entries are displayed at runtime.
Check the [schema.json](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/master/lib/core/app-config/schema.json) file
for further details about the structure and properties of `intervals` that you can set inside the configuration file.

Each defined `intervals` item is collected into its own collapsible category identified uniquely
by its `label`. The code snippet just above will result in the following display of facet intervals:

For more details refer to the :

-   [Facet intervals section of the Search Filter Component docs](../content-services/components/search-filter.component.md#facet-intervals) 

### SSO Role AuthGuard

The [Auth Guard SSO role service](../core/services/auth-guard-sso-role.service.md) implements an Angular
[route guard](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards)
to check the user has the right role permission. This is typically used with the
`canActivate` guard check in the route definition. The roles that user needs to have in order to access the route has to be specified in the roles array as in the example below:

```ts
const appRoutes: Routes = [
    ...
    {
        path: 'examplepath',
        component: ExampleComponent,
        canActivate: [ AuthGuardSsoRoleService ],
        data: { roles: ['USER_ROLE1', 'USER_ROLE2']}
    },
    ...
]
```

For more details refer to the :

-   [Facet intervals](../core/services/auth-guard-sso-role.service.md) 

### Improved accessibility

In terms of [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility), ADF version 3.1 introduces some bug fixes kindly requested from some customers and partners about [Section508](https://www.section508.gov/). Alfresco plans to introduce more enhancements from this point of view, so more improvements will be added in the next releases.

### Arabic and RTL languages support

Due to regular requests, we also decided to support the Arabic language in ADF. In ADF 3.1 the team introduces another new feature by starting the first iteration of support for Right To Left languages. Starting from ADF version 3.1, you can (easily) [change an ADF application to work correctly with a RTL language](../user-guide/rtl-support.md).

We are quite happy with the current support of RTL languages on ADF, but feedback is welcome if you find something that could be improved or added for a better user experience.

### ADF Testing pacakge

If you are creating e2e in your project where ADF is involved we have started to export some utils and pages in the package @alfresco/adf-testing pacakges. 

## Localisation

This release includes: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegian (Bokmål), Russian, Brazilian Portuguese and Simplified Chinese versions.

In the next version we plan to include as supported languages also: Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Czech, Polish.
