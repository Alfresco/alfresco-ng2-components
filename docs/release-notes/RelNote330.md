This release goes a step further in the direction of complete support for [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti.

All the enhancements are focused on forms, more in particular about: visibility management, multilingual support, validation, variables show and REST source for dropdown menus. Also from an end-user perspective, the start task can now contain a form.
