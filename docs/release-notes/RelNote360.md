### Array type supported in data table columns

Into the DataTable component you can now use arrays to define the key of a column.
Below an example of configuration.

{code:java}
    {
        "key": "variables[myText]",
        "type": "text",
        "title": "My Text",
        "cssClass": "desktop-only",
        "sortable": true
    } 
{code}

##Testing the polyfill enablement

The list of supported browsers for ADF is still valid and clear, but some developers would like to enable the polyfill to support older browser. Officially some "old browsers" are not supported, but more tests are done on this topic.

You can read further details [here](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/BROWSER-SUPPORT.md).
