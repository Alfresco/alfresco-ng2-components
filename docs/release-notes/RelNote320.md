## Goals for this release

This is the second minor release since ADF version 3 which was released in February 2019.

This release goes a step further in the direction of complete support for [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti. Also, some enhancements have been introduced to the Metadata viewer to properly manage multi-value properties, together with the event handling during header row action, to properly manage use cases like the drag & drop feature, requested from some developers.

We are pleased to announce that starting from ADF 3.2, five more languages are now supported, together with the other ten. The new languages are: Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Czech, Polish.

Please report issues with this release in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/issues/new). You can collaborate on this release or share feedback by using the discussion tools on [Gitter](http://gitter.im/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components).

### More on Activiti 7

In ADF 3.0.0 (released in February) we announced the introduction of the new `*Cloud` package. This contains a set of components to support [Activiti 7](https://www.activiti.org/), the next generation Cloud Native implementation of Activiti BPM Engine. With the ADF 3.2 release, the journey continues with more supported features, like:

### Five more languages supported

Starting from ADF 3.2, five more languages are now supported, together with the other ten already in the list. The new languages supported are: Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Czech, Polish.

### Event handling during header row action

Following some suggestions from customers and partners, we enhanced the `Datatable` to be able to manage event handling during header row action. Two more events have been added: `header-drop` raised when data is dropped on the column header and `cell-drop` raised when data is dropped on the column cell.

For more details refer to the:
- [DataTable component](../core/components/datatable.component.md).

### List separator configuration in multi-value metadata

As of this version of ADF, developers can configure the list separator of multi-value properties into the metadata viewer. Since this version of ADF, to customize the separator you can set it in your `app.config.json` file inside your `content-metadata` configuration. Below an example.

```json
"content-metadata": {
    "presets": {
        ...
    },
    "multi-value-pipe-separator" : " - "
}
```

For more details refer to the:
- [Content Metadata Card component](../content-services/components/content-metadata-card.component.md) 

## Localisation

This release includes: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l), Russian, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Czech, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Simplified Chinese versions.
