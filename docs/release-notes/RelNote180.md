# Alfresco Application Development Framework, version 1.8.0 Release Note

These release notes provide information for the **1.8.0 release** of Alfresco Application Development Framework.

This is the next **Limited Available** release of Application Development Framework, containing the Angular components to build a Web Application on top of the Alfresco Services.
The release can be found on GitHub at [this link.](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/releases/tag/1.7.0)

## Goals for this release

In the ADF 1.8 release we've introduced a number of new generic features, such as Info Drawer, theming capabilities and lots of form customizations and accessibility. The task list now works with the pagination component and we have started the work to completely redesign the viewer component.
We continue the effort to migrate to @angular/material, it will be a few more releases before we wrap up that work. The data table and document list continue to get new features and enhancements, with the new data sources and layout presets we open up possibilities for externalizing the layout and sources for the document list.

This release builds on last month's contains bug fixes and new feature. See the list below for major details.

Please report issues with this release in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/issues). You can collaborate on this release or share feedback by using the discussion tools on [gitter](https://gitter.im/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components).

### 1. Theming ADF component

We have added in ADF several pre-built theme css files. These theme files also include all of the styles for core (styles common to all components), so you only have to include a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
When you want more customization than a pre-built theme offers, you can create your own theme file. You need to include the packages only what you really use in your application. For more information about theming please refer to the [offiicial documentation.](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/docs/theming.md)

### 2. Info Drawer component

It is now possible to use the Info Drawer component, which gives you a sidebar like look with tabbing support. For more information about the usage, check the documentation in the core package.

![](images/info-drawer.gif)

### 3. Form style component enhancements

We have completed the transition from mdl to material2 for the form components. In addition we have also improved the style of some form components.

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+16.51.41.png)

### 4. Empty form template

You can now add an empty template that will be shown if no form definition are present

```
<adf-form .... >
   <div empty-form >
       <h2>Empty form</h2>
    </div>
</adf-form>
```

### 5. Form Validation Enhancements

New events that allow taking control over the Form and Field validation:

```
validateForm: Subject<ValidateFormEvent>
validateFormField: Subject<ValidateFormFieldEvent>()
```

The [validateForm](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/ng2-components/ng2-activiti-form/src/events/validate-form.event.ts) event is raised every time the entire Form is re-validated. This happens also every time a field value or some of the properties is changed (for example the "required" property). The [validateFormField](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/ng2-components/ng2-activiti-form/src/events/validate-form-field.event.ts) event is raised every time a single Form Field is re-validated.

Both events are "cancellable", that means you can apply your own validation rules, change corresponding field validation state, or even prevent the default behaviour if needed.

Example:

```
this.formService.validateFormField.subscribe(
  (event: ValidateFormFieldEvent) => {
    const field = event.field;
    const form = event.form;
    // do some custom validation based on field or form

    // set validation as "failed" and prevent any further checks
    event.isValid = false;
    event.preventDefault();
  }
);
```

### 6. FormFieldModel/FormModel improvements

#### FormFieldModel

The "required" property now re-validates the corresponding Field and entire Form upon every change. That enables scenarios when the "required" constraint is changed dynamically for a field based on some external factors.

#### FormModel

New "getFieldById" method to simplify certain scenarios when accessing multiple fields by id

```
getFieldById(fieldId: string): FormFieldModel
```

The Form now controls all Field validators. It becomes possible managing existing validator instances, replacing them, or extending form validation with custom rules and error messages. The "adf-form" component now also supports binding custom validator sets to the underlying FormModel, that allows defining validation sets in your code and binding via HTML.

You can read more details on the new Validation layer in the Form readme: [Form Field Validators](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/development/ng2-components/ng2-activiti-form#form-field-validators). The "demo shell" application has been also extended to demonstrate custom validators in action. You can check the code here: [Demo Field Validator](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/demo-shell-ng2/app/components/activiti/demo-field-validator.ts).

### 7. DataTable Accessibility Improvements

The "**DataTable**" component has got multiple accessibility improvements. That means all derived components (Document List, Tas/Process List, etc) get the same set of features automatically.

The major features are:

-   tabbing through the column headers (including Shift-Tab to tab backwards)
-   tabbing through the individual row cells (including Shift-Tab to tab backwards)
-   focus rings for row cells and column headers
-   keyboard (Enter key) support for column headers: sorting order change
-   keyboard (Enter key) support for rows: navigate to a folder or initiate a file preview

### 8. Copy and move component enhancements

Further enhancements were implemented for the Copy & move dialog. From now, you can see the path of a selected item, navigate back with the breadcrumbs and select the folder you entered.

![](images/copy-and-move-II.gif)

### 9. Download as a ZIP functionality

The ADF framework provides support for downloading nodes (Files and Folders) as "ZIP" archives. The **alfresco-js-api** library features new support for the [Downloads](https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/#/downloads) API. In addition, the Core library (ng2-alfresco-core) provides a "DownloadZipDialogComponent" that allows invoking "Download as Zip" dialogues from any place in your code.

![](images/download-as-zip.gif)

You can see a working button handler code in the following [resource](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/development/demo-shell-ng2/app/components/files/files.component.ts#L234).

### 10. Tooltips for DataTable/DocumentList cells

It is now possible to provide a custom tooltip for every column in the DataTable and derived components.

```
<data-column
    title="Name"
    key="name"
    [formatTooltip]="getNodeNameTooltip"
    class="full-width ellipsis-cell">
</data-column>
```

And the code behind in this case can be as follows:

```
import { DataColumn, DataRow } from 'ng2-alfresco-datatable';

@Component({...})
export class MyComponent {
    ...

    getNodeNameTooltip(row: DataRow, col: DataColumn): string {
        if (row) {
            return row.getValue('name');
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

### 11. Profile picture in Comments and Involved people

With the new ADF release, if the user has a profile picture, it will be shown inside the Comment/Involved People component:

![involved people component with images](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+11.31.50.png)

![adf comment component with profile image](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+11.38.58.png)

### 12. Support for additional data sources in Document List

#### Column Types

DocumentList component now provides various enhancements for existing, and support for additional column types:

-   **date**: additional "timeAgo" format value for dates, automatically switches to full date for periods longer than a week
-   **fileSize**: displays the size of the File node, including conversion to KB, MB, etc.
-   **location**: renders a hyperlink to the node's parent folder, allows navigating to a particular route based on the "format" value settings

You can get more details on the column types in the "[Column Types](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/development/ng2-components/ng2-alfresco-documentlist#column-types)" section of the documentation.

#### Data Sources and Layout Presets

DocumentList now also supports extra data sources. You can now set the "**currentFolderId**" property to one of the following values:

-   -trashcan-
-   -sharedlinks-
-   -sites-
-   -favorites-
-   -recent-

The component provides reasonable column defaults for each custom source, so you can use an empty **adf-document-list** tag in HTML templates, and the layout will be automatically adopted.

![](images/dl-custom-sources.gif)

You can get more details on the data sources and default presets in the [Data Sources](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/development/ng2-components/ng2-alfresco-documentlist#data-sources) section.

### 13. Directive to disable element or component based on node permission

The Core ADF library (ng2-alfresco-core) features a new **adf-node-permission** directive that allows you to selectively disable or enable an HTML element or an Angular component based on the node permissions. You can bind one or multiple nodes by means of the **adf-nodes** property that becomes available for each element.

For example toggling the state of the toolbar button based on the DocumentList selection state (selected nodes):

```
<adf-toolbar title="toolbar example">
    <button md-icon-button
            adf-node-permission="delete"
            [adf-nodes]="documentList.selection">
        <md-icon>delete</md-icon>
    </button>
</adf-toolbar>

<adf-document-list #documentList ...>
 ...
</adf-document-list>
```

You can find all the details and usage examples in the directive documentation: [Node Permission Directive](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/development/ng2-components/ng2-alfresco-core#node-permission-directive).

### 14. Task/Process Audit Log Directive

With the latest ADF release, we got two new directives **adf-process-audit** and **adf-task-audit**. Using these directives is very easily create a button to download the Task Audit or the Process Audit pdf.
In the case you are using the **adf-process-audit**  the only parameters that are needed are:

-   process-id
-   fileName
-   format (pdf or json)

```
<button
   md-icon-button
   adf-process-audit
   [process-id]="processInstanceDetails.id"
   [fileName]="'Process Audit - ' + processInstanceDetails.id"
   (error)="onAuditError($event)">
<md-icon mdTooltip="Process Audit">assignment_ind</md-icon>
</button>
```

You can see how it looks like the button after the bind:

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+09.42.03.png)

On the click process audit pdf will be downloaded:

![download process audit ](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-04+at+12.10.25.png)

In the case you are using the **adf-task-audit**  the only parameters that are needed are:

-   task-id
-   fileName
-   format (pdf or json)

```
<button
   md-icon-button
   adf-task-audit
   [task-id]="taskId"
   [fileName]="'Task Audit - ' + taskId"
   (error)="onAuditError($event)">
<md-icon mdTooltip="Task Audit">assignment_ind</md-icon>
</button>
```

You can see how it looks like the button after the bind:

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+16.31.30.png)

On the click the task audit pdf will be downloaded:

![task audit pdf](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+10.58.23.png)

### 15. Task List Pagination

With the latest ADF release, the adf-tasklist is fully compatible with the adf-pagination component. Although ADF doesn't provide a  single component that includes the adf-tasklist and the adf-pagination in a single component, is not so difficult create your custom component that binds the adf-tasklist and the adf-pagination.

This is how the pagination looks like:

![task list pagination](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-04+at+13.15.18.png)

tasklist-pagination.html

```
<activiti-tasklist
    [appId]="'2002'"
    [assignment]="'assignee'"
    [state]="'open'"
    [sort]="'created-desc'"
    [page]="page"
    [size]="pagination.maxItems"
    #activititasklist>
</activiti-tasklist>

<adf-pagination
    [pagination]="pagination"
    [supportedPageSizes]="[5, 10, 15, 20]"
    (changePageNumber)="onChangePageNumber($event)"
    (changePageSize)="onChangePageSize($event)"
    (nextPage)="onNextPage($event)"
    (prevPage)="onPrevPage($event)">
</adf-pagination>
```

tasklist-pagination.ts

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Pagination } from 'alfresco-js-api';
import { TaskListService } from 'ng2-activiti-tasklist';

@Component({
    selector: 'tasklist-paginator',
    templateUrl: './activiti-tasklist-paginator.component.html'
})
export class TasklistPaginatorComponent implements OnInit {

    pagination: Pagination = {
        skipCount: 0,
        maxItems: 5,
        totalItems:  
    };

    page: number = 0;

    constructor(private taskListService: TaskListService) {
    }

    ngOnInit() {
        this.taskListService.tasksList$.subscribe(
            (tasks) => {
                this.pagination = {count: tasks.data.length, maxItems: this.pagination.maxItems, skipCount: this.pagination.skipCount, totalItems: tasks.total};
            }, (err) => {
            console.log('err');
        });

    }

    onPrevPage(pagination: Pagination): void {
        this.pagination.skipCount = pagination.skipCount;
        this.page--;
    }

    onNextPage(pagination: Pagination): void {
        this.pagination.skipCount = pagination.skipCount;
        this.page++;
    }

    onChangePageSize(pagination: Pagination): void {
        const { maxItems, skipCount } = pagination;
        this.page = (skipCount && maxItems) ? Math.floor(skipCount / maxItems) : 0;
        this.pagination.maxItems = maxItems;
        this.pagination.skipCount = skipCount;
    }

    onChangePageNumber(pagination: Pagination): void {
        this.pagination.skipCount = pagination.skipCount;
        this.page = Math.floor(pagination.skipCount / pagination.maxItems);
    }

}
```

You can still tune the styles for the focus rings from within your application, or switch them off if needed via custom css.

### 16. Migrate to @angular/material date picker component

From 1.8.0 we moved all the date picker present in the ng2-activiti-form and ng2-activiti-diagrams to the standard @angular/material date picker

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-09-05+at+16.21.35.png)

### 17. File Viewer design update and new features

With 1.8.0 release ADF starts building a foundation for a new Viewer Dialog and Viewer Service implementations to back the improved file viewing experience.
In the current release, you can test a basic implementation of the Viewer Dialog component used to view image/text/video/music/pdf files.

![](images/Screenshot+2017-09-05+14.00.57.png)

This dialogue does not require extra HTML elements in your templates and can be opened from any place in your code using Viewer Service:

```
if (node.isFile) {
  this.viewerService.showViewerForNode(node);
}
```

Note that the dialog component and the underlying service are in the early preview and APIs are subject to change in the future releases.
