### 2. Datatable loading state

Is now possible define your custom loading template that will be shown during the loading of your data in the datatable:

    <alfresco-datatable
        [data]="data"
        [loading]=isLoading()">

            <loading-content-template>
                <ng-template>
                   <!--Add your custom loading template here-->
                    <md-progress-spinner
                        class="adf-document-list-loading-margin"
                        [color]="'primary'"
                        [mode]="'indeterminate'">
                    </md-progress-spinner>
                </ng-template>
            </loading-content-template>

    </alfresco-datatable>

Refer to the [datable documentation](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/master/ng2-components/ng2-alfresco-datatable#loading-content-template) for further details. With this modify also the n2-alfresco-documentlist has gained a loading state.

### 3. New extension support in viewer

The ng2-alfresco-viewer is now able to show files with txt extension natively and play wav and Mp3 files.

### 4. Extend TypeScript definitions for JS-API

We have added more methods in the type definition file of the alfresco-js-api to help you with the autocomplete of your IDE.

### 5. ADF Card View

The ADF Card is a generic component, which shows the properties received in input as a material design card.  The main idea was to create a component that can be shared among different components.

    <adf-card-view
        [properties]="[{label: 'My Label', value: 'My value'}]">
    </adf-card-view>

The properties are an array of CardViewModel

    export class CardViewModel {
        label: string;
        value: any;
        key: any;
        format: string;
        default: string;

        constructor(obj?: any) {
            this.label = obj.label || '';
            this.value = obj.value;
            this.key = obj.key;
            this.format = obj.format;
            this.default = obj.default;
        }
    }

As properties you can set the label, the value and other optional fields, such as the format and the default values.
Specifically, the **format** propriety is useful to show a value in a custom format, for example, the date in DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY
The **default** values allow initializing some properties as defined, in case the value provided is empty.

### 6. Task Header Component

This component was already present in the previous ADF versions but we changed the design and the code using the ADF Card Component.
The Task Header shows all the information related to the task.

    <div *ngIf="taskDetails">
        <div class="mdl-grid mdl-shadow--2dp">
            <adf-card-view [properties]="properties"></adf-card-view>
        </div>
    </div>

Result:

![Task Header Component](images/Screen+Shot+2017-06-29+at+11.28.48.png)

### 7. Process and Task attachment list component

This component shows all the attachments added to a task/process as a list. The component is using the [data table component](../../lib/core/datatable/components/datatable/datatable.component.ts) to show the list and the context menu with the actions. At the moment, you can open the attachment doing the double click on the row or select the action view from the menu actions. There is also the ability to download the attachment or remove it.

    <alfresco-datatable *ngIf="!isEmpty()"
        [rows]="attachments"
        [actions]="true"
        (rowDblClick)="openContent($event)"
        (showRowActionsMenu)="onShowRowActionsMenu($event)"
        (executeRowAction)="onExecuteRowAction($event)">
        <data-columns>
            <data-column key="icon" type="icon" srTitle="Thumbnail" [sortable]="false"></data-column>
            <data-column key="name" type="text" title="Name" class="full-width ellipsis-cell" [sortable]="true"></data-column>
            <data-column key="created" type="date" format="shortDate" title="Date"></data-column>
        </data-columns>
    </alfresco-datatable>

Result:

![Attachment list component](images/Screen+Shot+2017-06-29+at+11.39.00.png)

### 8. Add people Component

This component was already present in the previous ADF versions but we changed the design and improve the code.

With this component, you can easily involve a person into a task. The component itself is composed of two different component, the [search component,](../content-services/components/search.component.md) the [people list component](../process-services/components/people-list.component.md).

The [search component](../content-services/components/search.component.md) has the goal to find a person not involved and show the results in a list. The list is always a [data table component](../../lib/core/datatable/components/datatable/datatable.component.ts) with the action menu disabled.

The [people list component](../process-services/components/people-list.component.md) shows all the people involved in a task in a list.

The component is a wrapper of the data-table component with a custom action i.e. Remove the person from the list.

    <div class="assignment-container" *ngIf="showAssignment">
        <activiti-people-search
            (searchPeople)="searchUser($event)"
            (success)="involveUser($event)"
            (closeSearch)="onCloseSearch()"
            [results]="peopleSearch$">
            </activiti-people-search>
    </div>
    <div class="assignment-list-container" id="assignment-people-list" *ngIf="hasPeople()">
       <adf-people-list [users]="people">
          <data-columns>
            <data-column key="firstName">
              <ng-template let-entry="$implicit">
                <div class="people-pic">{{getInitialUserName(entry.row.obj.firstName, entry.row.obj.lastName)}}</div>
              </ng-template>
            </data-column>
            <data-column key="email" class="full-width">
              <ng-template let-entry="$implicit">
                <div class="adf-people-full-name">{{ getDisplayUser(entry.row.obj.firstName, entry.row.obj.lastName, ' ') }}</div>
                <div class="adf-people-email">{{ entry.row.obj.email }}</div>
                <div class="adf-people-edit-label">can edit</div>
              </ng-template>
            </data-column>
          </data-columns>
       </adf-people-list>
    </div>

Add people search person result:

### 9. Breadcrumb root path personalisation

The Breadcrumbs has received a little cosmetic upgrade plus we have added also a new property.

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-06-29+at+01.06.36.png)

The new property is **root**. You can specify in the root property the name of the folder where you want to tart the breadcrumb. Note: The root will always be shown as first element and it will continue to be displayed until you are not in a subfolder of it.

Example:

    <adf-breadcrumb
         [target]="documentList"
         [root]="'New-Root'"
         [folderNode]="newRootId">
    </adf-breadcrumb>

Result:

![](images/Screen+Shot+2017-06-29+at+01.13.54.png)

Note: The root will always be showed as first element and it will continue to be displayed until you are not in a subfolder of it.

Refer to the [document list documentation](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/master/ng2-components/ng2-alfresco-documentlist#properties-1) for further details.

### 10. Form events bus

If you want to listen to all the events fired from the form you can subscribe to this [`Subject`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html):

    formService.formEvents.subscribe((event: Event) => {
      console.log('Event fired:' + event.type);
      console.log('Event Target:' + event.target);
    });

Refer to the [form documentation](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/tree/master/ng2-components/ng2-activiti-form#listen-all-form-events)
for further details.

### 11. Form render independent from APS

The 1.6.1 release lays a foundation for making a [`Form`](../../lib/process-services/task-list/models/form.model.ts) renderer independent from the backend and APS services to allow more granular control of how it works and where takes/stores its data.

#### Binding "form" definition

With this release, it is now possible to bind a form definition via the "form" property.

    <activiti-form [form]="form">
    </activiti-form>

And the underlying component controller code can be as follows:

    export class FormDemoComponent implements OnInit {

      form: FormModel;

      ngOnInit() {
        let formDefinitionJSON: any = DemoForm.getDefinition();
        let form = this.formService.parseForm(formDefinitionJSON);
        this.form = form;
      }
    }

#### Parsing form definitions

The [`FormService`](../core/services/form.service.md) got a new API to parse form definitions from JSON into the [`FormModel`](../../lib/core/form/components/widgets/core/form.model.ts) instances without using [`Form`](../../lib/process-services/task-list/models/form.model.ts) Component like it was previously.

    formService.parseForm(formDefinitionJSON)

#### Controlling outcome actions

It is now possible to control what happens when end users click the form outcome buttons, like Save, Complete, etc. The [`FormService`](../core/services/form.service.md) gets a new cancellable event called "executeOutcome" for that purpose.

    export class FormDemoComponent implements OnInit {

      constructor(private formService: FormService) {
        formService.executeOutcome.subscribe(e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          console.log(e.outcome);
        });
      }

    }

### 12. Application settings (server-side)

It is now possible to have global (server-side) settings that enable or disable certain features in your web application.

By default, all application settings are stored in the "app.config.json" file in the root of your web application and have the following defaults:

    {
        "ecmHost": "http://localhost:3000/ecm",
        "bpmHost": "http://localhost:3000/bpm",
        "application": {
            "name": "Alfresco"
        }
    }

You can get more details on application configuration in the following articles:

-   [Demo App Readme](../..//demo-shell/README.md#application-settings-server-side)
-   [AppConfigService Readme](../core/services/app-config.service.md)

### 13. Proxy settings and CORS

To greatly simplify development process the demo and generated applications now feature Proxy settings for webpack development server. That allows using ACS/APS services without any CORS configurations.

You get the following settings by default (also applied to the Application settings)

-   <http://localhost:3000/ecm> is mapped to <http://localhost:8080>
-   <http://localhost:3000/bpm> is mapped to <http://localhost:9999>

### 14. Login restyling

![](images/Jun-29-2017+13-01-12.gif)

The settings above address most common scenarios for running ACS on port 8080 and APS on port 9999 and allow you to skip the CORS configuration.

If you would like to change default proxy settings, please edit the "**config/webpack.common.js**" file.
