### Additional support for content and metadata management

After some time  the content and metadata management hasn't been loved enough, with this version of ADF there are a good number of improvements on the way to consume content metadata in ADF components and ADF based applications. Most of them are developed for an improved and more appealing end-user experience.

As one of the most requested enhancements, it would be valuable to highlight the changed User Experience in the metadata editing on the adf-card-view-component ([ADF-4900](https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ADF-4900)). Below picture showing it.

### Improved accessibility
