We expect all discussion about the project (on GitHub, social media and other channels) to be positive and constructive.
We do not accept personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults,
or other unprofessional conduct towards anyone.

We promise to show respect to all contributors regardless of their gender, gender identity,

We expect all contributors to understand and follow these standards
If any member of the community does not follow the code of conduct,
the maintainers will do whatever they consider appropriate to stop the unacceptable behavior.
This may include removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts.
Any bans may be temporary or permanent, at the maintainersâ€™ discretion.
