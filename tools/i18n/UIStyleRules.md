# UI text style guide in rule form

This document lists the guidelines from the
[Alfresco UI style guide](https://docs.alfresco.com/sites/docs.alfresco.com/files/public/docs_team/u2/Alfresco-Writing-Guide.pdf)
in the form of separate rules. The list can be used in a checking procedure to identify
specific types of mistake and suggest solutions. However, the main
[style guide](https://docs.alfresco.com/sites/docs.alfresco.com/files/public/docs_team/u2/Alfresco-Writing-Guide.pdf)
remains the definitive source for the guidelines and explains and develops the reasons for
style choices in greater depth.

## Rules

### SG0001: Polite words are not recommended

People tend to find direct commands ("do this", "go here") very rude in everyday conversation.
However, in UI text, the meaning is very different. Saying "use xxx to solve problem yyy" reads
as a recommendation ("if you think you have problem yyy then using xxx is a good way to solve it").
Using expressions like "please", "thank you", and "feel free" takes up space and makes the text less
direct and easy to read.
