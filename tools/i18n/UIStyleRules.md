# UI text style guide in rule form

This document lists the guidelines from the
[Alfresco UI style guide](https://docs.alfresco.com/sites/docs.alfresco.com/files/public/docs_team/u2/Alfresco-Writing-Guide.pdf)
in the form of separate rules. The list can be as a check to identify
specific types of mistake and suggest solutions. However, the main
[style guide](https://docs.alfresco.com/sites/docs.alfresco.com/files/public/docs_team/u2/Alfresco-Writing-Guide.pdf)
remains the definitive source for the guidelines and explains and develops the reasons for
style choices in greater depth.

## Rules

### SG0001: Avoid polite words ("please", "thank you")

People tend to find direct commands ("do this", "go here") very rude in everyday conversation.
However, in UI text, the meaning is very different. Saying "use xxx to solve problem yyy" reads
as a recommendation ("if you think you have problem yyy then using xxx is a good way to solve it").
Using expressions like "please", "thank you", and "feel free" takes up space and makes the text less
direct and easy to read.

### SG0002: Avoid interjections ("oops", "wow", "yeah")

It is quite common for UI text to include words like this to add a bit of fun to the UI. It is
Alfresco's style to avoid these words to keep the UI more "serious" and professional.

### SG0003: Avoid exclamations ("!")

Exclamations generally look as though they are supposed to be funny or angry. This doesn't
fit in well with Alfresco's professional UI style.

### SG0004: Avoid unusual punctuation (";", "~", "^")

Some of these punctuation marks are valid English but their meaning is often subtle are they
are rarely used. The text is generally clearer without them, especially for a user who isn't
a native English speaker.

### SG0005: Don't use the ampersand ("&") as a replacement for "and"

The ampersand ("&") character is common in signs and captions but isn't normally used in
messages and body text. Use the word "and" in full.

### SG0006: Write numbers using digits instead of words

Numbers take up a lot more screen space when they are written out as words ("one hundred
and twenty three") instead of digits ("123"). Style guides differ on this issue but Alfresco's
style is to prefer digits over words when writing numbers. The exception is for numbers from
1 million upwards. For these, write digits followed by "million", "billion", etc. Something like
"10 billion" is easier to read than 10000000000.

### SG0007: Contractions ("can't", "won't" "isn't") are usually better than equivalent phrase

Contractions such as "can't", "won't" and "isn't" are shorter and more familiar than "cannot",
"will not", "is not" and help to make the UI seem a bit friendlier. Avoid the full phrase except
in cases where you want to emphasise an instruction very strongly ("Do not change these settings
unless you are sure you need to do so").

###SG0008: Leave out trademark and copyright symbols

There is no legal requirement to use trademark and copyright symbols ("™", "©", "®") in UI
text. They will be covered in the docs if they are needed at all, so don't use them in the UI.
